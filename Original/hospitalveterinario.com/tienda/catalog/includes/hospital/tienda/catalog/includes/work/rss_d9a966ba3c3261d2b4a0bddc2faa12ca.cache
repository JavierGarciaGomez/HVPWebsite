<br />
I hate looking at Contact Us Pages that only contain a web-based enquiry form, I like to know who and where the shop is. This change will provide a more professional look to the stock OSC Contact Us page, with enhanced functions.<br />
<br />
What It does:<br />
<br />
The Enhanced Contact Us page provides more information to the customer, such as Store Address, Telephone Number, Opening Hours, Anticipated Response Times Etc. (tailor these in the language files)<br />
<br />
Also, if the customer is logged in to their account, it pre-populates their email address and allows them to select a previous order to enquire about from a drop-down box.<br />
<br />
The email that is sent to the store contains the originators IP address, Date and time etc.<br />
<br />
Easy Installation - 1 New File + 2 Language file additions.<br />
Screen shot included.<br />
